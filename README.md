# FSJSproject01
Full Stack Java Script Project 01 - Treehouse TechDegree Program

In this project you'll create a random quote generator to display quotations on the screen after a button on the page is clicked: for example, display a quote from a famous athlete, politician, or historical figure like:

"The only thing to fear is fear itself." â€” Franklin Delano Roosevelt.

You'll need to use your knowledge of basic JavaScript syntax including variables, loops and object literals to complete this project.

We'll give you basic HTML and CSS as well a JavaScript file containing some code to help you get started. But you'll have to find the quotes yourself and build the data structure to store them in.
